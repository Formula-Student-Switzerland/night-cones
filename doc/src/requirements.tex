\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{ReqTable}
    \ReqHeader
    \ReqItem{R:Cone}{The NightCone can be mounted on top of a cone as used in formula student events. \cite{FSG:Rules_2024}}
    \ReqItem{R:Light}{The NightCone illuminates the cone underneath and its enclosure sufficient to be seen at dusk and night. The cone should be easily visible from a normal driving position and by track marshals. }
    \ReqItem{R:Power}{The NightCone is internally powered. }
    \ReqItemMM{R:Time}{The cone runs for the estimated time of a skidpad or acceleration event}{$\SI{4}{\hour}$}{N/A}
    \ReqItem{R:Color}{The color of the NightCone can be adjusted. }
    \ReqItem{R:Blink}{Simple light modes (eg. Blinking) can be set. }
    \ReqItem{R:Control}{A centralized control system (eg. Laptop, smartphone) is capable of controlling the NightCones. }
    \ReqItem{R:Usability}{An untrained person is capable of using the system after the initial setup is completed. }
    \ReqItem{R:Disable}{All components can be disabled by the means of an analog shut-down device. }
    \ReqItem{R:Flying}{The change in mass and center of gravity does not lead to a significant change in the flying characteristics of the cone. }
    \ReqItem{R:Charging}{When a battery is used to power the cone, the battery can be charged without opening the enclosure. }

\subsection{Safety requirements}
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{ReqTable}
    \ReqHeader
    \ReqItem{R:Failsafe}{A failure of the controller leads to a defined safe-state. The safe-state must provide at least a minimum amount of illumination. }
    \ReqItem{R:Change}{An unintended change of the color setting must be prevented. }
    \ReqItem{R:Short}{A short circuit of the battery or the charging port must be prevented. }
    \ReqItem{R:Current}{The NightCone must include overcurrent protected on for the battery. }
    \ReqItem{R:BMS}{The battery must be protected against deep-discharge, over-charge and over-temperature. }
    \ReqItem{R:Rain}{The NightCone must be able to operate in rain. The enclosure fulfills an ingress protection of at least IP54. }
    \ReqItem{R:Crash}{The components of the NightCone are protected when the cone is hit by a car. The hit cone must not pose any additional danger. The functionality of the cone can be deteriorated after the impact. }
    \ReqItem{R:Edges}{The NightCone has no additional excessively sharp edges. }
    \ReqItem{R:Mass}{The additional mass must not pose an increased danger. }
    \end{ReqTable}
